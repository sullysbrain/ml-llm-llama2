# Building AI LLM App with LangChain, OpenAI, and Llama 2

I will be building out a web deployed LLM built with the help of LangChain, using Meta's and Microsoft's Llama 2.0. The initial focus is building LangChain and getting it up and running. The second phase will be switching away from the OpenAI model and using Llama 2.0.

Also interested in adding use of SageMaker and DataIku as part of the pipeline if appropriate.
